//In this document, I will show the step-by-step process of sorting a list  
//using the quicksort algorithm.  
//The unsorted list is: [-5, 42, 6, 19, 11, 25, 26, -3]  
//  
//
//First, we will choose a pivot. In this case, we will pick the last element, -3.  
//Partition the list so that elements smaller than -3 go to the left,  
//and elements larger go to the right.  
//Compare -5 with -3. Since -5 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 42 with -3. Since 42 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Compare 6 with -3. Since 6 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Compare 19 with -3. Since 19 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Compare 11 with -3. Since 11 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Compare 25 with -3. Since 25 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Compare 26 with -3. Since 26 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Swap -3 with the first larger element (42).  
//The list now looks like this: [-5, -3, 6, 19, 11, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Next, we recursively sort the left and right partitions.  
//The left side only contains [-5], so it is already sorted.  
//Now, we sort the right side: [6, 19, 11, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//We pick the last element, 42, as the pivot.  
//Compare 6 with 42. Since 6 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 19 with 42. Since 19 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 11 with 42. Since 11 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 25 with 42. Since 25 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 26 with 42. Since 26 is smaller, leave it.  
//Since all elements are smaller, the pivot remains in place.  
//The list remains: [-5, -3, 6, 19, 11, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Next, we sort the sublist [6, 19, 11, 25, 26]  
//Pick the last element, 26, as the pivot.  
//Compare 6 with 26. Since 6 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 19 with 26. Since 19 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 11 with 26. Since 11 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 25 with 26. Since 25 is smaller, leave it.  
//Since all elements are smaller, the pivot remains in place.  
//The list remains: [-5, -3, 6, 19, 11, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Now, we sort the sublist [6, 19, 11, 25]  
//Pick 25 as the pivot.  
//Compare 6 with 25. Since 6 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 19 with 25. Since 19 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 11 with 25. Since 11 is smaller, leave it.  
//Since all elements are smaller, the pivot remains in place.  
//The list remains: [-5, -3, 6, 19, 11, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Now, we sort the sublist [6, 19, 11]  
//Pick 11 as the pivot.  
//Compare 6 with 11. Since 6 is smaller, leave it.  
//Compare 19 with 11. Since 19 is larger, move it to the right.  
//Swap 11 with the first larger element (19).  
//The list now looks like this: [-5, -3, 6, 11, 19, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Now, we sort the sublist [6], which is already sorted.  
//Since there are no more values to sort, the final sorted list is:  
//[-5, -3, 6, 11, 19, 25, 26, 42]  
//  
//
//Since there are no more values to process, the list has fully been sorted  
//with quicksort.
